# CWRU Bootcamp Challenge 10 - SVG Logo Generator
    
## Description
    
### The goal of this project was to create an SVG Logo that accepts user input using Inquirer and outputs a logo.svg file. I used Jest to test and make sure everything was working correctly! Those tests can be found in the tests folder and can be run using "npx jest" after running "npm install".
